This is an SELinux policy I've developed for Splunk on CentOS 6 as part of "The Audit Experiment" (https://github.com/doksu/splunk_auditd/wiki/The-Audit-Experiment), and will continue to undergo minor refinements. As with any SELinux policy, it allows Splunk to do what it was designed to do: collect, index and search information. The policy essentially allows Splunk to read just about anything on the system and free reign in terms of networking (network traffic should be confined with iptables, as Splunk has too many port permutations to make TE suitable). This policy does however prevent Splunk from writing to almost all file types. If using NFS shares, mount them in fstab with the following argument:

context="system_u:object_r:splunk_rw_t:s0"

Should you mount a filesystem for index buckets outside of /opt/splunk, then be sure to assign the splunk_rw_t file type to that path. For example:

1. semanage fcontext -a -t splunk_rw_t '/data(/.*)?'
2. restorecon -R /data

I would strongly recommend you run this policy with the splunk_t domain in permissive (as per step 4 below), until you're confident it works correctly.

How to use this policy:
1. yum install policycoreutils-python setools-console setools-devel
2. make -f /usr/share/selinux/devel/Makefile
3. semodule -i splunk.pp
4. semanage permissive -a splunk_t
5. restorecon -R /opt/splunk
6. restorecon /etc/init.d/splunk
7. service splunk restart

Confirm Splunk is running in the splunk_t domain by running: ps -auxZ | grep splunk

Don't forget to use the Linux Auditd app for Splunk to better understand SELinux audit events: https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2642/

If you find any denied access vectors, be sure to let me know so that I can update this policy.
